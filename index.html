<h2>The best franchise in the NBA</h2>

<p>This is a website about <i>The Celtics</i>, I will be telling you all about the past success,
    the current roster and all about the current team, I will also talk about my personal favorite celtic players of all time.
    The reason the Celtics is the best franchise of all time isn't only because They have 17 championships.
    It's also because they have the best fans. A home game at the Boston Garden is unlike any other stadium.
    Also we've had a history of bringing in great players that want to stay and become our franchise players</p>
